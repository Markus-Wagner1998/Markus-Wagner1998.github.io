                <p>Hi, my name is Markus Wagner and I'm a tech enthusiast.
                    I love technology in all its facets.
                    I buy new keyboards and mice every year and my apartment is filled with smart home gadgets.
                    However, my life's not all about technology though.
                    Recently I found joy in reading good books and brewing the perfect cup of espresso.
                    But most importantly, I am a proud Cat-Dad of my lovely red cat Linux.</p>

                I am Senior IT Consultant and Tech Lead for all non-SAP related topics in my unit. This means, I am the
                Lead Full-Stack DevOps Engineer for our Cloud Developments and I am responsible for guiding new and less
                experienced colleagues in technical questions.
                I am currently committing a training program to become a certified IT and Cloud Architect.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>I am now officially the tech lead for all non-SAP related topics in our unit. I am the
                        technically
                        responsible person for all our cloud solutions and, as we call them, Business Services.
                        I still am the leading Full-Stack DevOps Engineer in our Cloud Developments and also I spend
                        quite some time "architecturing the cloud" and guiding new colleagues. I am currently guiding
                        two new colleagues as well as two working students in their (cloud-related) work and help them,
                        whenever technical or architectural questions arise.
                        I have not reached my final goals yet, and I am still developing my skills. This year, I am
                        doing an official training to become a certified IT-Architect, which will help my architectural
                        decisions in the future for sure.

                    <p>After spending some time as the associate in the team, it was time to take over some
                        responsibility myself. We started moving to the cloud. A field where I have already gathered
                        lots of knowledge in my free-time, even more knowledge than most of my colleagues had at that
                        time. This was the perfect ground for me to take over a leading technical position
                        with some architectural focus. That, what I wanted to do since I started Software Engineering.
                        So, together with a colleague of mine we build the first cloud architecture to migrate our
                        already finished smartFIX Product smartRIA to the Cloud. During development I took over a
                        leading developer position, guiding new colleagues and being involved in the important
                        decisions. With this first successful cloud project, we moved to our next development and with
                        that our first Cloud-Native Development. By not just migrating, but rebuilding one of our most
                        attrative Software Solutions we moved towards the future, where everything is easily accessible
                        in the cloud and no customer has to care for expensive servers and operations teams. In this new
                        development project, I took over a leading Full-Stack DevOps Engineer Position with a lot of
                        architectural focus.
                        I was the main architect, setting up the general architecture, the deployment, runtime stacks
                        and used libraries and frameworks. During time of development, I was and still am one
                        of the two leading Full-Stack Developers and I am the responsible one for our DevOps
                        environment.

                    <p>I started working in January 2017 during my first semester. I started of as a Software Engineer
                        in the SAP / ABAP world. Here I learned a lot about Software Engineering and the everyday
                        problems software engineers have to face. After some time I moved on to some smartFIX product
                        development where I learned even more about Software Engineering and also a lot about Software
                        Testing and Test-Driven-Development, which is a concept I have internalized by now. These few
                        years as a working student and as an associate have taught me the main important things that a
                        software engineer has to do. This is of course, to write high-quality code. But this also
                        includes testing and documenting the software. Releasing the software. Fixing Bugs and possibly
                        even hotfix software in customer projects. And I learned to really enjoy the whole process.</p>

                    <p>I started studying Computer Science at the University of Passau in 2016 at the age of 18. Already
                        during the first semesters, I realized, that I want to be a Software Engineer. I loved all
                        courses that told us about Software Engineering Concepts and Patterns, Algorithms and
                        Datastructures as well as Programming in general. I tried to specialize in the fields
                        of Software Engineering and Programming, that's why the two courses where you had the
                        possibility to choose were Practical Parallel Programming and Software Testing. And, as
                        expected, I really appreciated both of them. I wrote my bachelor's thesis at the Chair of Data
                        Science about a machine learning topic, which is a very interesting field of research but not
                        what I want to do in the long run. This thesis also denotes the end of my studies, since I
                        finished in 2019 at the age of 21 as best of year with a final grade of 1,1.</p>
