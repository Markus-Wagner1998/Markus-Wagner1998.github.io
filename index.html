                <p>Hi, my name is Markus Wagner and I'm a tech enthusiast.
                    I love technology in all its facets.
                    I buy new keyboards and mice every year and my apartment is filled with smart home gadgets.
                    However, my life's not all about technology though.
                    Recently I found joy in reading good books and brewing the perfect cup of coffee.
                    But most importantly, I am a proud Cat-Dad of my lovely red cat <span

                    <p>After all the years spending as the associate in the team, it was time to take over some
                        responsibility myself. We started moving to the cloud. A field where I have already gathered
                        lots of knowledge in my free-time, even more knowledge than most of my colleagues had at that
                        time. These were the perfect building blocks for me to take over a leading technical position
                        with some architectural focus. That, what I wanted to do since I started Software Engineering.
                        So, together with a colleague of mine we build the first cloud architecture to migrate our
                        already finished smartFIX Product smartRIA to the Cloud. During development I took over a
                        leading developer position, guiding new colleagues and being involved in the important
                        decisions. With this first successful cloud project, we moved to our next development and with
                        that our first Cloud-Native Development. By not just migrating, but Rebuilding one of our most
                        attrative Software Solutions we move towards the future, where everything is easily accessible
                        in the cloud and no customer has to care for expensive servers and operations teams. In this new
                        development, even more than before, I took over a leading Full-Stack DevOps Engineer Position
                        with a lot of architectural focus. A colleague of mine and me, we designed the architecture and
                        setup the Runtime Stacks and used libraries. During time of development, I was and still am one
                        of the two leading Full-Stack Developers and I am the responsible one for our DevOps
                        environment. I am currently guiding to Working Students within my team, who really support us
                        during development and have been integrated to be a vital part of the team. The project is not
                        finished yet. We have just about reached MVP-Status, but I really like the approach we're going
                        and how this project is helping me with my personal development, so I hope this will go on for a
                        very long time.

                    <p>I started working in january 2017 during my first semester. I started of as a Software Engineer
                        in the SAP / ABAP world. Here I learned a lot about Software Engineering and the everyday
                        problems software engineers have to face. After some time I moved on to some smartFIX product
                        development where I learned even more about Software Engineering and also a lot about Software
                        Testing and Test-Driven-Development, which is a concept I have internalized by now. These few
                        years as a working student and as an associate have taught me the main important things that a
                        software engineer has to do. This is of course, to write high-quality code. But this also
                        includes testing and documenting the software. Releasing the software. Fix Bugs and possibly
                        even hotfix software in customer projects. And I learned to really enjoy the whole process.</p>

                    <p>I started studying Computer Science at the University of Passau in 2016 at the age of 18. Already
                        during the first semesters, I realized, that I want to be a Software Engineer. I loved all
                        courses that told us about Software Engineering Concepts and Patterns, Algorithms and
                        Datastructures and Programming in general. I also really enjoyed the field of mathematics where
                        I had to attend three different courses during my studies. I tried to specialize in the fields
                        of Software Engineering and Programming, that's why the two courses where you had the
                        possibility to choose were Practical Parallel Programming and Software Testing. And, as
                        expected, I really appreciated both of them. I wrote my bachelor's thesis at the Chair of Data
                        Science about a machine learning topic, which is a very interesting field of research but not
                        what I want to do in the long run. This thesis also denotes the end of my studies, since I
                        finished in 2019 at the age of 21 as best of year with a final grade of 1,1.</p>

                        I started my career by studying Computer Science at the
                        University
                        of
                        Passau. My studies presented me, that there are three main topics of Computer Science, that
                        I am
                        really into. These are Software Development, Software Testing and Archtitecture. In order to
                        build
                        up skills in all these fields and reassure, that this is what I want to do for the rest of
                        my
                        life,
                        I started working as a Student Software Engineer at msg systems ag in Passau already during
                        my first semester. My starting point was as a SAP / ABAP Developer in the Reinsurance Area,
                        where
                        I spent most of my Working Student Time. I finished my Bachelor's Degree in 2019 as Best of
                        Year
                        with a final Grade of 1,1. Afterwards I continued working at msg and moved into the field of
                        automation and input management. Also in this field, my first steps began in the Reinsurance
                        Area,
                        where we developed a smartFIX Product called smartRIA to automate the processing of
                        Reinsurance
                        Accountings. These two products gave me lots of insights on the aspects of Software
                        Engineering
                        and
                        Software Testing. I built lots of knowledge in these fields, but I also learned that I want
                        to
                        take
                        part in design
                        decisions, testing concepts and all the conceptional tasks, that are there. I don't want to
                        be a
                        pure programmer. As much insight as I got in the fields of Development and Testing, as few
                        insights
                        I got in the architectural decisions. In the SAP world I worked at more or less feature
                        complete
                        products, where no architectural decisions had to be made and smartFIX does not leave
                        architecture
                        decisions to you. This makes the next step in my career even more valuable. We started
                        moving
                        our
                        Solutions to the Cloud. Which for one meant, that we had to design cloud architectures,
                        because
                        we
                        started in a green field and two, that we built a new team where I could try to to fill a
                        leading
                        position.
                        The next steps went as good as possible (or even better). Firtsly we started by migrating
                        smartRIA
                        to
                        the Cloud by providing all its interfaces via Rest Endpoints and taking all the operations
                        aspects.
                        Here, together with a colleague of mine, I developed the architectural design and checked
                        for
                        technical doability. During the project, this colleague of mine and me took over the
                        technical
                        lead
                        in that project by guiding other colleagues, making design decisions, managing our cloud
                        infrastructure and onboarding new customers.
                        With a first successful cloud project in our pockets we became more confident and started
                        our
                        own
                        Cloud-Native Application Development. By not just migrating, but rebuilding one of our most
                        successful Software Solutions, the <a

                            Table Upload</a>, into the Cloud as a Service. If you are more interested in how we
                        rebuilt

                        existing On-Premise Smart

                            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4RG7dewhTs&t=1s">Tech-Talk</a> a colleague of
                        mine
                        and me
                        gave during the msg series Cloud Insights. During this project, even more than before I took
                        over
                        technical leadership and am now, again together with my colleague, the leading developer,
                        test
                        manager and software architect in this project.
                        All these projects gave me insights on where I want to go. If you ask me, where I see myself
                        in
                        5
                        years, here is a short but concise answer. I still want to be a software engineer. However I
                        love
                        architecturing new (Cloud) software, which is hopefully a large part of my daily job by
                        then.
                        Furthermore, I really enjoy training new colleagues, especially young ones. I am already
                        mentor
                        for
                        two working students and I don't want this to decrease in the future. If it's my decision,
                        then
                        this
                        even increases in the future.
